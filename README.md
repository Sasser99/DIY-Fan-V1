## Story

I came up with the idea to develop a modular, battery-powered, open-source fan built around high-end gaming PC fans. This time, however, the fans aren’t meant to cool computer components — they’re meant to cool people. Additionally, the goal was to create a visually appealing and functional design.

The device essentially consists of three main modules: the so-called FAN stage, the main electronics module, and the tripod. There are also connecting elements between the modules — however, these are optional.

The electronics module provides approximately 10 W of power. When using, as in my case, the fans Noctua NF-A12x25 PWM chromax.black.swap, up to five fan stages can be operated with it.
